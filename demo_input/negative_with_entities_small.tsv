The measured Mir-18 crew skin dose equivalent rate was 1133 microSv/day .	Mir-18
The influence of microgravity on voluntary and electrically evoked contractions of the triceps surae ( TS ) of seven crewmembers was studied before and after spaceflights ( space MIR flights : MIR-18 , -22 , -25 , -26 , and -27 ) .	TS	MIR	MIR-18
Eligible patients were to have a glycated hemoglobin ( HbA1c ) value < or = 8.5 % and mean fasting plasma glucose ( FPG ) concentrations < or = 200 mg/dL while receiving MIR 500 mg BID for at least 8 weeks .	hemoglobin	MIR 500	BID	mg	FPG	dL
After a 2-week , single-blind lead-in period , patients were randomly assigned to receive MXR 1000 or 1500 mg QD for 24 weeks or to continue MIR 500 mg BID for 24 weeks .	mg	MXR	a 2	BID	MIR 500
The mechanism by which secretion is modified by miR-375 is independent of changes in glucose metabolism or intracellular Ca2+-signalling but correlated with a direct effect on insulin exocytosis .	miR-375	insulin	Ca2
Some human miRNAs are linked to leukemias : the miR-15a/miR-16 locus is frequently deleted or down-regulated in patients with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia and miR-142 is at a translocation site found in a case of aggressive B-cell leukemia .	miR-15a	B	miR-142	miR-16
We propose that specific microRNAs , such as Mirn122a , could be involved in the posttranscriptional regulation of mRNAs such as Tnp2 in the mammalian testis .	Tnp2	Mirn122a
Enforced expression of the mir-17-92 cluster acted with c-myc expression to accelerate tumour development in a mouse B-cell lymphoma model .	c-myc	B	mir-17-92
Tumours derived from haematopoietic stem cells expressing a subset of the mir-17-92 cluster and c-myc could be distinguished by an absence of apoptosis that was otherwise prevalent in c-myc-induced lymphomas .	c-myc	mir-17-92
