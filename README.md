# corpus-to-graph-ml
This repository contains machine learning related work for the corpus to graph project, including Jupyter research notebooks and a Flask webservice to host the model.

The packages folder contains python code with the main logic for the data transformation and the feature generation tools.

Â The webservice contains an example for a flask based scoring service that can be used in order to expose the trained model.

The data_preparation notebook contains an example of running the data transformation pipeline, and the features_classification notebook contains code examples for generating different features and training and evaluating different classifiers.

The only missing piece that shold be provided is an entity recognition endpoint (specifically here we used [GNAT](http://gnat.sourceforge.net/)). You can also alternatively provide a text file with the results of the entity recognition process.

#Dependencies:

We highly recommend using the [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) distribution (or any similiar distribution), to make your life easier, as it comes with most of the packages we use in this notebook. 

In our notebooks, we use the following libraries:

 - [SKlearn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html) (comes pre-installed with Anaconda)
 - [NLTK](http://www.nltk.org/install.html) (make sure to install the NLTK stopwords, lemmatization, and stemming packages by [calling nltk.download() manually](http://www.nltk.org/data.html))
 - [gensim](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/install.html) (Make sure that you have *cython* installed beforehand in order run it the optimized version of the code)
 - [spacy.io](https://spacy.io/docs/#getting-started) - For spacy - make sure you the english model installed 
 - [requests](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/requests)
